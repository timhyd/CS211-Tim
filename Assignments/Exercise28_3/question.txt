(Implement DFS using a stack) The depth-first search algorithm described in
Listing 28.8 uses recursion. Design a new algorithm without using recursion.
Describe it using pseudocode. Implement it by defining a new class named
UnweightedGraphWithNonrecursiveDFS that extends UnweightedGraph
and overriding the dfs method.
